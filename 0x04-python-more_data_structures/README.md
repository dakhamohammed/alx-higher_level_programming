### Files
1. **0-square_matrix_simple.py** & **0-main.py**
   - Python function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.
     - matrix is a 2 dimensional array
     - Returns a new matrix:
       - Same size as matrix
       - Each value should be the square of the value of the input

2. **1-search_replace.py** & **1-main.py**
   - Python function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.
     - my_list is the initial list
     - search is the element to replace in the list
     - replace is the new element

3. **2-uniq_add.py** & **2-main.py**
   - Python function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer).

4. **3-common_elements.py** & **3-main.py**
   - Python function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.
