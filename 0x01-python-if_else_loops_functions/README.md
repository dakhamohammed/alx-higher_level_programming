       - if the number is greater than 0: is positive
       - if the number is 0: is zero
       - if the number is less than 0: is negative

2. 1-last_digit.py
   - Print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.
     - The output of the program should be:
       - The string Last digit of, followed by
       - the number, followed by
       - the string is, followed by the last digit of number, followed by
         - if the last digit is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
         - if the last digit is 0: the string and is 0
         - if the last digit is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
