### Files:

1. 0-positive_or_negative.py
   - Print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.
     - The output of the program should be:
       - The number, followed by
       - if the number is greater than 0: is positive
       - if the number is 0: is zero
       - if the number is less than 0: is negative

2. 1-last_digit.py
   - Print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.
     - The output of the program should be:
       - The string Last digit of, followed by
       - the number, followed by
       - the string is, followed by the last digit of number, followed by
         - if the last digit is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
         - if the last digit is 0: the string and is 0
         - if the last digit is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0

3. 2-print_alphabet.py
   - Python program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

4. 3-print_alphabt.py
   - Python program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
     - Print all the letters except q and e

5. 4-print_hexa.py
   - Python program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal
     - 8 = 0x8
     - 9 = 0x9
     - 10 = 0xa
     - 11 = 0xb
     - 12 = 0xc
     - 15 = 0xf
     - 16 = 0x10
     - 17 = 0x11

6. 5-print_comb2.py
   - Python program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.
     - Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
     - Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
     - The last number should be followed by a new line

7. 6-print_comb3.py
   - Python program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
     - Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
     - The two digits must be different
     - 01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1
     - Print only the smallest combination of two digits
     - Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
     - The last number should be followed by a new line

8. 7-islower.py
   - Python function that checks for lowercase character.
     - Returns True if c is lowercase
     - Returns False otherwise

9. 8-uppercase.py
   - Python function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.

10. 9-print_last_digit.py
   - Python function that prints the last digit of a number.

11. 10-add.py
    - Python function that adds two integers and returns the result.

12. 11-pow.py
    - Python function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.

13. 12-fizzbuzz.py
    - Python function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.
      - For multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for multiples of five print Buzz.
      - For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

14. 13-insert_number.c, lists.h
    - Function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.
      - Return: the address of the new node, or NULL if it failed

15. 100-print_tebahpla.py
    - Python program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase)

16. 101-remove_char_at.py
    - Python function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n (not the Python way, the “C array index”).

17. 102-magic_calculation.py
    - Python function def magic_calculation(a, b, c): that does exactly the same as Python bytecode
