### Files
1. **0-print_list_integer.py** & **0-main.py**
   - Python function that prints all integers of a list.

2. **1-element_at.py** & **1-main.py**
   - Python function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.
     - If idx is negative, the function should return None
     - If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function should return None

3. **2-replace_in_list.py** & **2-main.py**
   - Python function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).
     - If idx is negative, the function should not modify anything, and returns the original list
     - If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function should not modify anything, and returns the original list

4. **3-print_reversed_list_integer.py** & **3-main.py**
   - Python function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.

5. **4-new_in_list.py** & **4-main.py**
   - Python function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).
     - If idx is negative, the function should return a copy of the original list
     - If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function should return a copy of the original list

6. **5-no_c.py** & **5-main.py**
   - Python function that removes all characters c and C from a string.

7. **6-print_matrix_integer.py** & 6-main.py
   - Python function that prints a matrix of integers.
