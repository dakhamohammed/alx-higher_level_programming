### Files
1. 0-print_list_integer.py & 0-main.py
   - Python function that prints all integers of a list.

2. 1-element_at.py & 1-main.py
   - Python function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.
     - If idx is negative, the function should return None
     - If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function should return None

3. 2-replace_in_list.py & 2-main.py
   - Python function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).
     - If idx is negative, the function should not modify anything, and returns the original list
     - If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function should not modify anything, and returns the original list

4. 3-print_reversed_list_integer.py & 3-main.py
   - Python function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.
